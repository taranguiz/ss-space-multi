Testing the effect of the entrainment of material in channels and mutidirection flow in hillslopes in strike-slip fault (ssf) settings.

The following work is based on one of the most recent developments of strike-slip fault models published by Nadine Reitmann (2019).

Her model includes uplift, erosion in the channels (stream power) with an erosion threshold, hillslope difussion and advection due to the strike-slip fault that depends on the x and y axis. 

In this work, I'm playing with the SPACE component from landlab and FlowDirectorMFD, to test the effect of this change in the geomorphic expression of the lateral faulting.
